<h2>Career</h2>
<p>
  Mackey was cast in her first professional role with the Netflix comedy-drama series Sex Education as Maeve
  Wiley, an intelligent, quick-witted, business-savvy "bad girl" who convinces fellow student Otis Milburn (Asa
  Butterfield) to start an underground sex therapy business at their school. She stated that "For me, this is my first
  piece of work. ... It was – and still is – a really happy time." Mackey's work on the series has earned her acclaim; The
  Hindustan Times wrote "Emma Mackey, as Maeve, is a revelation; perhaps the best performance by a young British actress
  I’ve seen since I discovered Florence Pugh. She’s alluring yet distant, pragmatic yet emotional, whip-smart yet
  foolishly in love." For the role, she received a BAFTA TV Award nomination in 2021.
